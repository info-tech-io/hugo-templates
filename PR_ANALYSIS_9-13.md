### Summary
Implements comprehensive **4-phase performance optimization framework** achieving **60-66% build time improvements** across all templates through intelligent caching, parallel processing, and performance monitoring. Includes critical bug fixes and complete documentation.

### Main Implementation Stages

#### Stage 1: Intelligent Caching System - Phase 1 (Sept 28, 03:30)
**Commit**: `feat(performance): implement intelligent caching system (Phase 1 of Child Issue #7)`

**Multi-Level Caching Architecture**:
- **L1 Cache**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- **L2 Cache**: Persistent disk cache for build artifacts
- **L3 Cache**: Network cache for remote resources and themes

**Features**:
- Content-based invalidation using SHA256 hash-based cache keys
- TTL management (configurable, default: 24 hours)
- Size management (automatic cleanup at 85% of 1GB threshold)
- Metadata tracking with timestamps and source info
- Performance statistics (hit/miss rates, build counts, cache size)
- Cross-platform compatibility (awk fallbacks when bc unavailable)

**CLI Options**:
- `--no-cache`: Disable caching for current build
- `--cache-clear`: Clear all cache before build
- `--cache-stats`: Show cache statistics after build

**Performance**: 90%+ build time reduction for unchanged templates (632ms → <50ms)

#### Stage 2: Parallel Processing & Monitoring - Phases 2-3 (Sept 28, 03:36)
**Commit**: `feat(performance): implement parallel processing + monitoring system (Phases 2-3 of Child Issue #7)`

**Phase 2: Parallel Processing Optimization**
- Intelligent parallel file operations (template, theme, content, Git submodules copied concurrently)
- Component-level parallelization with job throttling (max 4 concurrent)
- Smart execution strategy (automatic fallback to sequential for single component)
- User-controllable parallelism (`--no-parallel` flag)
- Proper PID tracking and wait synchronization

**Performance**: Up to 75% reduction in I/O time for complex templates

**Phase 3: Performance Monitoring System**
- Real-time performance tracking with millisecond precision
- Resource usage monitoring (memory consumption, file count, output size)
- JSON-based performance history with session tracking
- Smart analysis engine with color-coded status indicators
- Context-aware optimization recommendations
- Template performance breakdown with per-template statistics

**Storage**: ~/.hugo-template-perf/ for JSON-based historical data
