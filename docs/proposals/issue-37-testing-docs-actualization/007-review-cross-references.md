**Objective**: Ensure all documentation is consistent and cross-referenced

**Duration**: 10 minutes

**Dependencies**: Stages 2-6 complete

## Detailed Steps

### Step 7.1: Verify All Test Counts Match

**Action**: Check that all files show consistent test counts

**Files to Check**:
- [ ] `_index.md` shows 185 total (78+52+55)
- [ ] `test-inventory.md` shows 185 total
- [ ] `coverage-matrix.md` shows 185 total
- [ ] `integration-testing.md` shows 52 integration tests
- [ ] All math is correct (78+52+55=185)

**Verification**:
- [ ] All counts consistent
- [ ] No mentions of "78 total" remain
- [ ] Breakdown is consistent across files

---

### Step 7.2: Check All Internal Links

**Action**: Verify all links between testing documentation files work

**Links to Verify**:
- [ ] `_index.md` → `integration-testing.md`
- [ ] `_index.md` → `guidelines.md`
- [ ] `_index.md` → `test-inventory.md`
- [ ] `_index.md` → `coverage-matrix.md`
- [ ] `guidelines.md` references to Issues #31, #32, #35
- [ ] `integration-testing.md` references to other files

**Method**:
```bash
# Check for broken relative links
grep -r "](.*\.md)" docs/content/developer-docs/testing/
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] All markdown links use correct paths
- [ ] No broken links
- [ ] All issue references correct (#31, #32, #35)

---

### Step 7.3: Ensure Terminology Consistency

**Action**: Verify consistent use of terms across all files

**Terms to Check**:
- [ ] "integration tests" (not "integration testing" when referring to tests)
- [ ] "graceful error handling" (consistent capitalization)
- [ ] "structured logging" (consistent term)
- [ ] "`assert_log_message()`" (backticks around function names)
- [ ] "Issue #31" format (not "issue 31" or "#31" alone)

**Verification**:
- [ ] Terminology consistent
- [ ] Function names in backticks
- [ ] Issue references formatted correctly

---

### Step 7.4: Verify Code Examples

**Action**: Ensure all code examples are accurate and tested

**Code Blocks to Check**:
- [ ] `assert_log_message()` usage examples
- [ ] Graceful error handling pattern
- [ ] Test isolation pattern
- [ ] Integration test examples
- [ ] CI-specific patterns

**Verification Method**:
- Review examples against actual test files
- Ensure syntax is correct
- Verify patterns match current implementation

**Verification**:
- [ ] All code examples accurate
- [ ] Bash syntax correct
- [ ] Patterns match real tests

---

### Step 7.5: Check Issue References

**Action**: Verify all references to Issues #31, #32, #35 are correct

**References to Verify**:
- [ ] Issue numbers correct (#31, #32, #35)
- [ ] GitHub URLs correct (if any)
- [ ] Reference locations make sense
- [ ] Each issue credited for its contributions

**Verification**:
- [ ] All issue numbers correct
- [ ] Proper attribution for patterns
- [ ] No missing references
