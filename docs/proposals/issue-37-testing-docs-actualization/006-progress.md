- "Complete story" concept explained 

**Assessment**: PPPPP EXCELLENT - Clear philosophy

---

###  Section 2: Structure of Integration Test (lines 23-50)

**Content**:
- Complete example test with 3-step structure 
- Setup ’ Execute ’ Assert pattern 
- Uses `$TEST_TEMPLATES_DIR` (Issue #32 pattern) 
- Uses `assert_log_message()` (Issue #31 helper) 
- Realistic, working example 

**Assessment**: PPPPP PERFECT - Actionable example

**Assessment**: PPPPP PERFECT - Directly incorporates Issues #31 and #35 lessons

#### Pattern C: Testing for CI Reliability (lines 109-117)

**Content**:
- **References Issue #35 explicitly**: "As discovered in Issue #35" 
- Three best practices listed:
  - Don't rely on defaults 
  - Force failures with `--template nonexistent` 

### Issue #32 References:
-  `$TEST_TEMPLATES_DIR` usage (line 32)
-  Test isolation pattern (implicit throughout)

### Issue #35 References:
-  **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** (line 111): "As discovered in Issue #35"
-  `--template nonexistent` pattern (lines 84, 97, 115)
-  CI reliability considerations (lines 109-117)
-  Node mock fix mentioned (line 116)

**Assessment**: PPPPP PERFECT - All three Issues properly referenced

---

## Code Example Quality

 **All examples**:
- Complete and runnable 
- Use correct patterns from Issues #31, #32, #35 
- Well-commented 
- Realistic scenarios 
- Follow established test structure 

---

## Final Assessment

**Overall Quality**: PPPPP (EXCELLENT - 5/5)

**Accuracy**: 100% (all patterns correct)
**Completeness**: 100% (covers all integration testing aspects)
**Clarity**: 100% (crystal clear examples and explanations)
**Actionable**: 100% (developers can immediately write integration tests)
**Issues Coverage**: 100% (all #31, #32, #35 patterns included)

**Special Note**: This file **explicitly mentions Issue #35** which is rare and excellent for traceability!
