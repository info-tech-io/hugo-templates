# Stage 1: Analyze Current Documentation

**Objective**: Understand existing documentation structure and identify all update points

**Duration**: 15 minutes

**Dependencies**: None

---

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1.1: Read Existing Testing Documentation Files

**Action**: Read all 4 existing testing documentation files to understand current state

**Files to Read**:
1. `docs/content/developer-docs/testing/_index.md`
2. `docs/content/developer-docs/testing/guidelines.md`
3. `docs/content/developer-docs/testing/test-inventory.md`
4. `docs/content/developer-docs/testing/coverage-matrix.md`

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Read each file
cat docs/content/developer-docs/testing/_index.md
cat docs/content/developer-docs/testing/guidelines.md
cat docs/content/developer-docs/testing/test-inventory.md
cat docs/content/developer-docs/testing/coverage-matrix.md
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] All 4 files read and understood
- [ ] Current test counts noted
- [ ] Existing structure documented

---

### Step 1.2: Identify Update Points in Each File

**Action**: For each file, identify specific sections that need updates

**Analysis Tasks**:

**For `_index.md`**:
- [ ] Find where test counts are displayed
- [ ] Check if integration tests are mentioned
- [ ] Note pass rate statistics
- [ ] Identify where to add integration section

**For `guidelines.md`**:
- [ ] Check if `assert_log_message()` is documented
- [ ] Look for graceful error handling patterns
- [ ] Check for test isolation documentation
- [ ] Find helper functions section
- [ ] Identify where to add CI considerations

**For `test-inventory.md`**:
- [ ] Count listed tests (should be 78, outdated)
- [ ] Check test categorization structure
- [ ] Identify where to add integration tests (52 tests)

**For `coverage-matrix.md`**:
- [ ] Note current coverage percentages
- [ ] Check test count in calculations
- [ ] Identify where to add integration coverage

**Deliverable**: Detailed notes on each file's current state and needed changes

### Step 1.3: Review Issues #31, #32, #35 for Key Information

**Action**: Extract key testing patterns, helpers, and changes from the three issues

**Files to Review**:
1. `docs/proposals/issue-31-integration-tests-fix/design.md`
2. `docs/proposals/issue-31-integration-tests-fix/progress.md`
3. `docs/proposals/issue-32-test-isolation/design.md`
4. `docs/proposals/issue-32-test-isolation/progress.md`
5. `docs/proposals/issue-35-ci-test-failures/design.md`
6. `docs/proposals/issue-35-ci-test-failures/progress.md`

**Information to Extract**:

**From Issue #31**:
- [ ] `assert_log_message()` function signature and usage
- [ ] Graceful error handling pattern code examples
- [ ] Number of tests updated (17)
- [ ] Structured logging format details

**From Issue #32**:
- [ ] `ORIGINAL_PROJECT_ROOT` pattern explanation
- [ ] Test isolation setup code
- [ ] `TEST_TEMPLATES_DIR` usage pattern
- [ ] Number of tests updated (58 lines across 5 files)

**From Issue #35**:
- [ ] Node.js mock fix details
- [ ] `--template nonexistent` pattern
- [ ] CI output limit increase (500â†’1000)
- [ ] Number of CI tests fixed (7)
- [ ] Final test count (185/185)

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive list of patterns, helpers, and statistics to document

---

### Step 1.4: Create Detailed Update Plan

**Action**: Document before/after state for each documentation file

**Plan Format**:

**File: _index.md**
- Current: Shows 78 unit tests only
- Needed: Add 185 total (78 unit + 52 integration + 55 federation)
- Sections to add: Integration test overview
- Sections to update: Test statistics, pass rate

**File: guidelines.md**
- Current: Basic testing patterns
- Needed: Add 4 new sections:
  1. Graceful Error Handling Pattern
  2. Test Isolation Pattern
  3. Helper Functions (assert_log_message)
  4. CI-Specific Considerations

**File: test-inventory.md**
- Current: Lists 78 tests
- Needed: Add 52 integration tests by file
- Sections to add: Integration Test Suite section

**File: coverage-matrix.md**
- Current: 78 tests, outdated percentages
- Needed: Update to 185 tests, recalculate coverage

**File: integration-testing.md**
- Current: DOES NOT EXIST
- Needed: Create complete integration testing guide (~300 lines)

**Deliverable**: Clear update plan for Stages 2-8

## Testing Plan

### Verification Steps

1. **Documentation completeness check**:
   - [ ] All 4 existing files analyzed
   - [ ] All 3 Issues reviewed for content
   - [ ] Clear list of changes identified

2. **Accuracy check**:
   - [ ] Test counts verified (185 total)
   - [ ] Issue numbers correct (#31, #32, #35)
   - [ ] Pattern examples extracted correctly

3. **Plan quality check**:
   - [ ] Each file has clear before/after state
   - [ ] All new sections identified
   - [ ] Line count estimates reasonable

---

## Rollback Plan

No code changes in this stage - only analysis and planning. No rollback needed.

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 4 existing documentation files read and analyzed
- [ ] All 3 Issues (#31, #32, #35) reviewed for content
- [ ] Detailed update plan created for each file
- [ ] Test counts verified (185 total)
- [ ] All new patterns and helpers identified
- [ ] Clear list of sections to add/update
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Stage 2 (Update _index.md)

---

## Estimated Time

- Read 4 documentation files: 5 minutes
- Identify update points: 4 minutes
- Review 3 Issues: 4 minutes
- Create update plan: 2 minutes

**Total**: 15 minutes

---

## Notes

- This is a planning stage - no files are modified
- Detailed notes from this stage will guide Stages 2-8
- Take time to understand current structure before making changes
- Verify all statistics before documenting them
