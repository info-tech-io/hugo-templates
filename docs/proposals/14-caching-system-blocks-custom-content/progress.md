## 📈 Hypothesis Analysis Status

From `design.md`, ranked by probability:

| # | Hypothesis | Probability | Status | Verification Result |
|---|------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Cache key missing `$CONTENT` parameter | 90% 🔴 | ✅ **CONFIRMED** | Stage 1: Code inspection + cache key analysis |
| 2 | Content hash not recalculated | 60% 🟡 | ⏭️ SKIPPED | Not needed - #1 explains bug completely |
| 3 | Cache restoration timing issue | 40% 🟢 | ⏭️ SKIPPED | Not needed - #1 explains bug completely |
| 4 | Content variable overwrite | 20% 🟢 | ⏭️ SKIPPED | Not needed - #1 explains bug completely |
| 5 | Cache invalidation logic bug | 10% 🟢 | ⏭️ SKIPPED | Not needed - #1 explains bug completely |

**Result**: Hypothesis #1 confirmed in Stage 1. Root cause: lines 729, 768 in `build.sh` missing `${CONTENT}` variable.

## 🔍 Stage 1: Bug Reproduction - ✅ COMPLETE

### Objectives Achieved
- ✅ GitHub Pages workflow located and analyzed
- ✅ Test infrastructure created in production environment
- ✅ Cache key analysis performed with different content sources
- ✅ Bug confirmed through identical cache keys
- ✅ Root cause identified in code

### Success Criteria - All Met
- [x] GitHub Pages workflow found in `info-tech-io.github.io`
- [x] Bug reproduced through cache key analysis
- [x] Observable evidence documented (identical cache keys)
- [x] Reproducible - test workflow created for future verification
- [x] Production workaround confirmed (`--no-cache` in use)

### Evidence Collected
- [x] Test workflow: `test-cache-bug.yml` ([commits](https://github.com/info-tech-io/info-tech-io.github.io/commits/main))
- [x] Workflow runs: [#18221608898](https://github.com/info-tech-io/info-tech-io.github.io/actions/runs/18221608898), [#18221800796](https://github.com/info-tech-io/info-tech-io.github.io/actions/runs/18221800796)
- [x] Cache key comparison: Identical keys for different content
- [x] Code inspection: Lines 729, 768 in `scripts/build.sh`
- [x] Detailed report: [`001-progress.md`](./001-progress.md)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Bug reproduced, root cause identified
**Details**: See [`001-progress.md`](./001-progress.md)
