## 🐛 Bug Confirmation

**Bug Status**: ⏸️ PENDING VERIFICATION

### Expected Bug Behavior (from design.md)
- ✅ Cache hit recorded
- ❌ Page count < 10 (expected 370+)
- ❌ Output size < 100KB (expected ~10MB)
- ❌ Sample page shows template content (not corporate)
- ❌ Significant difference from baseline build

### Actual Observed Behavior
_To be documented after execution_

## 📝 Key Findings

_This section will summarize the key discoveries from Stage 1 execution_

### Bug Reproduced?
- [ ] YES - Bug confirmed, proceed to Stage 2 (Hypothesis Verification)
- [ ] NO - Bug not reproducible, reassess problem statement

### Hypothesis Support
_Which hypotheses from design.md are supported by reproduction evidence?_

1. **Hypothesis #1** (Cache key missing `$CONTENT`): _Pending assessment_
2. **Hypothesis #2** (Content hash not recalculated): _Pending assessment_
3. **Hypothesis #3** (Cache restoration timing): _Pending assessment_
4. **Hypothesis #4** (Content variable overwrite): _Pending assessment_
5. **Hypothesis #5** (Cache invalidation bug): _Pending assessment_

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (if bug confirmed)
1. Create Stage 2 plan: `002-hypothesis-verification.md`
2. Design tests to verify Hypothesis #1 (most likely)
3. Prepare debug logging additions to `build.sh`

### Alternative Actions (if bug NOT reproduced)
1. Reassess problem statement in `design.md`
2. Gather additional information from issue reporter
3. Review test methodology
