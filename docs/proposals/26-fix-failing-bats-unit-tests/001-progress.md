# Stage 1 Progress Report: Timeline Investigation

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Started**: 2025-10-09
**Completed**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

The timeline investigation is complete. The **critical finding** is that the BATS unit tests have been failing since the moment they were created. The issue is not a regression introduced during Epic #15, but a foundational problem with the tests themselves or their execution environment since their inception in Epic #2.

## Completed Steps

### Step 1.1: Find Test Creation Timeline
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Result**: Tests were created on **September 27, 2025**, in commit **`4ff828d`**.
- **Notes**: This was part of **Epic #2, Child Issue #4 (Comprehensive Test Coverage Framework)**.

### Step 1.2: Review Epic #2 Progress Reports
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Result**: Documentation for Epic #2 confirms the *intent* to create a test framework.
- **Notes**: There is no explicit evidence in the progress reports that the BATS tests were ever successfully run and passed within the CI/CD pipeline.

### Step 1.3: Check Epic #15 Child Issues for Breaking Changes
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Result**: No child issues in Epic #15 reported BATS test failures.
- **Notes**: This is because the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/bash-tests.yml`) to automatically run these tests was only recently activated. The failures were never visible to developers.

### Step 1.4: Test Each Commit Range
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Result**: Tests fail across all major commits, including the most recent `main` and the original creation commit.
- **Key Findings**:
    - `epic/federated-build-system` (current branch): **FAILS**
    - `main` (production branch): **FAILS**
    - `a206e51` (recent main commit): **FAILS**
    - `08fe0e0` (Epic #2 merge commit): **FAILS**
    - `4ff828d` (test creation commit): **FAILS**

### Step 1.5: Document Timeline and Changes
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Result**: The timeline is clear: the tests have never passed. The problem lies in the initial implementation of the tests, not in subsequent code changes.

## Test Results

| Commit | Branch/Event | Test Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `baeb185` | `epic/federated-build-system` | ❌ **FAIL** | Current state |
| `9b126a9` | `main` | ❌ **FAIL** | Production code is affected |
| `4ff828d` | Test Creation | ❌ **FAIL** | **Tests were broken from the start** |

## Issues Encountered
- The primary issue was the misleading assumption that the tests worked at some point. The investigation confirmed this was false.

## Changes from Original Plan
- The plan assumed a regression. The investigation shifted to a root cause analysis of the initial test implementation.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to **Stage 2: Root Cause Analysis** to understand the fundamental reasons for the test failures. The focus will be on the interaction between the test scripts (`*.bats`), the error handling system (`error-handling.sh`), and the BATS framework itself.
