# Stage 5 Progress Report: Test Coverage Enhancement

**Status**: ⏳ **PLANNED**
**Started**: Not started
**Completed**: Not completed

---

## Summary

Stage 5 focuses on adding missing tests based on coverage analysis from Stage 4. This stage will fill critical gaps and achieve ≥95% test coverage for core files.

**Current Status**: Planning complete, awaiting Stage 4 completion

**Dependencies**: Stage 4 must complete first (coverage matrix needed)

**Progress**:
- ✅ Stage 5 plan created (005-coverage-enhancement.md)
- ⏳ Step 5.1 (Analyze Coverage Gaps) - Not started
- ⏳ Step 5.2 (Design New Test Cases) - Not started
- ⏳ Step 5.3 (Implement HIGH Priority Tests) - Not started
- ⏳ Step 5.4 (Implement MEDIUM Priority Tests) - Not started
- ⏳ Step 5.5 (Add Integration Tests) - Not started
- ⏳ Step 5.6 (Update Documentation) - Not started
- ⏳ Step 5.7 (Validation) - Not started

- **Progress**: 0%
- **Target**: Update test-inventory.md and coverage-matrix.md

**Checklist**:
- [ ] test-inventory.md updated with new tests
- [ ] Test counts updated
- [ ] coverage-matrix.md updated
- [ ] Coverage percentages recalculated
- [ ] _index.md statistics updated

---

### Step 5.7: Validation and Quality Assurance
- **Status**: ⏳ Pending
- **Progress**: 0%
- **Target**: Verify ≥95% coverage achieved

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Full test suite passing (100%)
- [ ] No flaky tests (verified with multiple runs)
- [ ] Coverage ≥95% achieved for build.sh
- [ ] Coverage ≥95% achieved for error-handling.sh
- [ ] Validation report created
