## 📋 Tasks Breakdown

### Task 1.1: Add Federation Quick Start Examples (30 min)

**Goal**: Add federation examples to existing Quick Start section

**Actions**:
1. Add section "Federated Builds Quick Start" after existing examples
2. Include simple 2-module example
3. Include multi-module production example
4. Show command-line usage of federated-build.sh

**Example Code to Add**:
```bash
# Simple federation with 2 modules
./scripts/federated-build.sh --config=examples/modules-simple.json --output=federated-site

# Production InfoTech.io 5-module federation
./scripts/federated-build.sh --config=examples/modules-infotech.json --output=production --minify

# Dry-run to test configuration
./scripts/federated-build.sh --config=modules.json --dry-run
```

**Validation**:
- Code examples are accurate
- References to example files exist
- Commands can be copy-pasted and work

### Task 1.2: Create Federation Features Section (1 hour)

**Goal**: Add major section explaining federated build system

**Actions**:
1. Create new H2 section: "🌐 Federated Build System"
2. Add "What is Federation" subsection
3. Add "Why Use Federation" subsection
4. Add "Key Capabilities" subsection
5. Add "Federation vs Single-Site" comparison

**Content to Include**:

**What is Federation**:
- Orchestrate multiple Hugo sites from different repositories
- Merge content from distributed teams
- Deploy as unified GitHub Pages site
- Maintain module independence

**Why Use Federation**:
- Multi-team content collaboration
- Separate concerns (different repos, different teams)
- Independent module development and testing
- Centralized deployment

**Key Capabilities**:
- Multiple merge strategies (download-merge-deploy, merge-and-build, preserve-base-site)
- Intelligent conflict resolution
- Automatic CSS path rewriting
- Module-level configuration
- JSON Schema validation
- 140 tests (100% coverage)

**Validation**:
- Section is comprehensive but concise
- Benefits are clear
- Use cases are relatable

### Task 1.3: Update Architecture Diagram (30 min)

**Goal**: Show federated-build.sh in architecture

**Actions**:
1. Locate existing architecture diagram in README
2. Add `scripts/federated-build.sh` to scripts section
3. Add `schemas/modules.schema.json` to schemas
4. Add visual indication of Layer 1 vs Layer 2
5. Show federation flow: modules.json → federated-build.sh → merged output

**Diagram Updates**:
```
hugo-templates/
├── scripts/
│   ├── build.sh              # Layer 1: Single-site builds
│   ├── federated-build.sh    # Layer 2: Multi-module federation (NEW)
│   └── validate.js
├── schemas/
│   └── modules.schema.json   # Federation configuration schema (NEW)
├── docs/

│       └── examples/
│           ├── modules-simple.json
│           └── modules-infotech.json
```

**Validation**:
- Architecture accurately reflects current structure
- Federation components clearly marked
- Layer distinction is visible

**Actions**:
1. Add "Documentation" subsection to Federation section
2. Link to user guides
3. Link to tutorials
4. Link to developer docs
5. Link to migration guide
6. Link to API reference

## Documentation

### User Guides
- [Federated Builds Guide](docs/content/user-guides/federated-builds.md) - Complete configuration reference
- [Compatibility Guide](docs/content/user-guides/federation-compatibility.md) - When to use federation

### Tutorials
- [Simple 2-Module Tutorial](docs/content/tutorials/federation-simple-tutorial.md) - Get started quickly
- [Advanced 5-Module Tutorial](docs/content/tutorials/federation-advanced-tutorial.md) - Production scenarios
- [Migration Checklist](docs/content/tutorials/federation-migration-checklist.md) - Migrate from single-site

### Developer Documentation
- [Federation Architecture](docs/content/developer-docs/federation-architecture.md) - Technical design
- [API Reference](docs/content/developer-docs/federation-api-reference.md) - Function documentation
- [Testing Guide](docs/content/developer-docs/testing/federation-testing.md) - Testing federation code

### Examples
- [Simple Example](docs/content/examples/modules-simple.json) - 2-module federation
- [Advanced Example](docs/content/examples/modules-advanced.json) - Complex configuration
- [InfoTech.io Example](docs/content/examples/modules-infotech.json) - Production 5-module setup
```

**Validation**:
- All links point to correct files
- Links will be created in subsequent stages (note which don't exist yet)
- Navigation is logical

---

### Task 1.5: Add Federation Use Cases (30 min)

**Goal**: Provide real-world scenarios for federation

**Actions**:
1. Add "Use Cases" subsection
2. Describe InfoTech.io multi-team scenario
3. Describe multi-repository documentation
4. Describe content aggregation from multiple sources

**Use Cases to Document**:

**Use Case 1: InfoTech.io Multi-Team Scenario**:
```
Scenario: 5 teams, each with their own repository
- Team 1: Main documentation
- Team 2: API reference
- Team 3: Tutorials
- Team 4: Blog posts
- Team 5: FAQ and troubleshooting

Solution: Federated build merges all 5 modules into single site
Result: Unified documentation, independent team workflows
```

**Use Case 2: Multi-Repository Documentation**:
```
Scenario: Product with multiple components
- Core product docs in main repo
- Plugin docs in plugin repos
- Community content in separate repo

Solution: Federation pulls from all repos
Result: Complete documentation from distributed sources
```

**Use Case 3: Content from Multiple Sources**:
```
Scenario: Static site with content from different CMSs
- Editorial content from Git
- Product data from external API
- User-generated content from database

Solution: Pre-process to Hugo modules, federate
Result: Unified static site from multiple sources
```

**Validation**:
- Use cases are realistic and relatable
- Solutions clearly explain federation value
- Examples match actual capabilities

```bash
grep -A 5 "federated-build.sh" README.md | head -20
# Should show command examples
```

### Count Federation Mentions
```bash
grep -i "federation\|federated" README.md | wc -l
# Should be > 20
```

### Validate Links
```bash
# Extract all doc links
grep -o '\[.*\](docs/[^)]*)' README.md | \
  grep -o '(docs/[^)]*)' | tr -d '()' | \
  while read link; do
    if [ -f "$link" ]; then
      echo "✅ $link"
    else
      echo "⚠️  Future: $link (will be created in next stages)"
    fi
  done
```

### Check Architecture Diagram
```bash
grep -A 20 "hugo-templates/" README.md | grep "federated-build.sh"

- Complete federation features section
- Updated architecture diagram
- Documentation navigation links
- Real-world use cases (InfoTech.io, multi-repo, etc.)

Federation section: ~220 lines added
Position: After quick start, before detailed architecture

## 📝 Notes

### Key Points
- README is most visible documentation - make it count
- Position federation as major feature, not add-on
- Link to docs even if they don't exist yet (forward-compatible)
- Use real InfoTech.io example to show production readiness

### What NOT to Do
- Don't duplicate user guide content in README
- Don't add too much technical detail (save for developer docs)
- Don't break existing README structure
- Don't remove or modify existing features

### Dependencies for Next Stages
- Links added here will be validated in Stage 2-4
- Examples referenced here will be used in tutorials
- Use cases here will be expanded in user guides
