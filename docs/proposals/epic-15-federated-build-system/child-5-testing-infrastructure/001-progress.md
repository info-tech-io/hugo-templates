# Stage 1: Test Infrastructure & Audit - Progress Tracking

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-10-18
**Completed**: 2025-10-18
**Estimated Duration**: 4 hours
**Actual Duration**: ~8 hours (including critical bug fixes)

## Checklist

### Step 1.1: Audit Existing Tests ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Review 37 shell script tests
- [x] Create federation function coverage matrix
- [x] Document test organization strategy
- [x] Create audit-results.md

### Step 1.2: Create Test Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create 4 BATS test files with boilerplate
- [x] Create tests/bash/fixtures/federation/ structure
- [x] Create at least 5 fixture configs
- [x] Create mock repositories (repo-a, repo-b)
- [x] Enhance test-helpers.bash with federation helpers

### Step 1.3: Create Unified Test Runner ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create tests/run-federation-tests.sh
- [x] Update scripts/test-bash.sh with --suite federation
- [x] Add --layer filter (layer1, layer2, integration, all)
- [x] All 37 shell script tests passing via test runner ⭐

### Step 1.4: Critical Bug Fixes ✅ COMPLETE (Unplanned)
- [x] Fixed heredoc syntax error in federated-build.sh
- [x] Made federated-build.sh sourceable for testing
- [x] Fixed arithmetic expansion hangs (set -e + ERR trap issue)
- [x] Fixed merge strategy logic (rsync + conflict detection)
- [x] Achieved 100% shell test pass rate (37/37)

## Progress Summary

**Completion**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE** (with additional bug fixes)

**Major Achievements**:
- ✅ All infrastructure created and operational
- ✅ Test runner fully functional with layer filtering
- ✅ **37/37 shell script tests passing (100%)** ⭐
- ✅ 4 critical bugs fixed in federated-build.sh
- ✅ Test harness proven stable and reliable

**Shell Test Results**:
- test-schema-validation.sh: ✅ 16/16 passing
- test-css-path-detection.sh: ✅ 5/5 passing
- test-css-path-rewriting.sh: ✅ 5/5 passing
- test-download-pages.sh: ✅ 5/5 passing
- test-intelligent-merge.sh: ✅ 6/6 passing (fixed from 0/6!)

**Blockers**: None

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
1. **Heredoc Syntax Error** (Line 2192)
   - Impact: Script failed to parse
   - Fix: Separated closing delimiter from text

2. **Script Auto-Execution**
   - Impact: Tests couldn't source functions
   - Fix: Wrapped main() in BASH_SOURCE check

3. **Arithmetic Expansion Hangs**
   - Impact: `((counter++))` with set -e triggered ERR trap
   - Fix: Added `|| true` to 6 critical increments

4. **Merge Strategy Failures**
   - Impact: rsync skipped updates, tests failed
   - Fix: Added -I flag + proper conflict detection

## Commits Made

1. `e8e7856` - fix(federated-build): correct heredoc delimiter syntax
2. `7a2070b` - fix(federated-build): make script testable and more robust
3. `67a5927` - fix(tests): prevent test hangs from set -e and arithmetic expansions
4. `f5d2f59` - fix(merge): fix merge strategies to achieve 100% shell test pass rate

## Technical Notes

**ERR Trap Discovery**: The combination of `set -euo pipefail` + ERR trap from error-handling.sh created a subtle bug where arithmetic expressions like `((COUNTER++))` would hang when COUNTER=0 (because 0 is false in arithmetic context, returning exit code 1).

**rsync Timestamp Issue**: Tests creating files in rapid succession had identical mtimes, causing rsync to skip updates. Solution: `-I` flag forces content-based comparison.

**Test Methodology**: Incremental debugging with isolated test scripts proved essential for identifying the root cause.
