## Overview

Implement the Download-Merge-Deploy pattern for incremental federated builds, enabling preservation of existing content while adding new module content.

## Stages

### Stage 1: Download Existing Pages ⬜ (0%)
**Status**: Not Started
**Duration**: 4 hours
**Progress File**: `001-progress.md`

**Objective**: Download existing GitHub Pages content for preservation

**Key Deliverables**:
- `download_existing_pages()` function
- Integration with `--preserve-base-site` flag
- Download progress reporting
- Edge case handling
- Test suite: `tests/test-download-pages.sh`

### Stage 2: Intelligent Merging ⬜ (0%)
**Status**: Not Started
**Duration**: 4 hours
**Progress File**: `002-progress.md`
**Dependencies**: Stage 1

**Objective**: Implement conflict detection and merge strategies

**Key Deliverables**:
- `detect_merge_conflicts()` function
- `merge_with_strategy()` function
- Enhanced `merge_federation_output()`
- Merge strategy schema field
- Test suite: `tests/test-intelligent-merge.sh`

### Stage 3: Deploy Preparation ⬜ (0%)
**Status**: Not Started
**Duration**: 4 hours
**Progress File**: `003-progress.md`
**Dependencies**: Stages 1 & 2

**Objective**: Deployment-ready artifact preparation and validation

**Key Deliverables**:
- Enhanced `validate_federation_output()`
- `generate_deployment_artifacts()` function
- Enhanced deployment manifest
- `verify_deployment_ready()` function
- Deployment guide documentation

## Timeline

| Stage | Duration | Dependencies | Start | Status |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------|--------|
| Stage 1: Download | 4 hours | None | TBD | ⬜ Not Started |
| Stage 2: Merge | 4 hours | Stage 1 | TBD | ⬜ Not Started |
| Stage 3: Deploy Prep | 4 hours | Stages 1 & 2 | TBD | ⬜ Not Started |

**Total Estimated**: 12 hours (~1.5 days)

## Next Actions

1. Create feature branch `feature/download-merge-deploy`
2. Start Stage 1, Step 1.1: Implement `download_existing_pages()`
3. Update `001-progress.md` as work progresses
4. Test each step before moving to next
5. Complete all 6 steps of Stage 1
6. Move to Stage 2

## Notes

- All 3 stage plans are detailed and ready
- Test suites designed for each stage
- Backward compatibility maintained (--preserve-base-site is optional)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Foundation built upon Child #16, #17, #18 work
