# Use Cases and User Stories

This document describes typical usage scenarios for the Hugo Template Factory Framework from the perspective of different users.

---

## Use Case #1: Quick Start for Beginners

**User:** Anna, an educator who wants to launch her blog with educational materials and quizzes. She's an expert in her subject but has limited web development experience.

**Goal:** Get a beautiful, modern website with a working quiz system without diving into the technical details of Hugo, themes, and plugins.

### User Story

> **As** an educator,
> **I want** to quickly create a ready-to-use website using an interactive assistant that asks me a few simple questions,
> **So that** I can focus on writing content and creating quizzes instead of configuring the project.

### Anna's Experience

Anna opens the terminal and executes just one command:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh --template=default --theme=compose --components=quiz-engine --output=my-course-blog
```

**Alternative Interactive Approach (Future Enhancement):**
```bash
# Future enhancement - interactive mode
./scripts/build.sh --interactive
```

The framework would start a dialog:
```
? Enter your site name: My Web Design Course
? Choose site template (default is great for blogs):
❯ default
  minimal
  academic
  enterprise
? Choose theme:
❯ compose
  minimal
? Add additional components? (Space to select)
❯ ◉ quiz-engine  (Interactive quiz system)
  ◯ analytics     (Web analytics)
  ◯ auth          (Authentication)
```

After answering these questions, the framework automatically creates a fully configured, ready-to-use project in the `my-course-blog` folder. Anna just needs to go to the `content` folder and start writing her articles and quizzes. **She gets results in 2 minutes without writing a single line of configuration code.**

### Performance Tracking

Anna can also monitor her site's build performance:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh \
  --template=default \
  --theme=compose \
  --components=quiz-engine \
  --output=my-course-blog \
  --performance-track \
  --performance-report
```

## Use Case #2: Client Prototype

**User:** Boris, a freelancer who creates websites for clients. He needs to quickly create a prototype for a client.

**Goal:** Build a lightweight, fast website with a corporate theme, but without unnecessary features like quizzes or blogs, to show the client the concept.

### User Story

> **As** a freelancer,
> **I want** to build a site from "building blocks" with a single command, choosing a minimal template and the theme I need, excluding all unnecessary components,
> **So that** I can quickly get a speed-optimized prototype that exactly meets the client's requirements.

### Boris's Experience

Boris is an experienced user. He doesn't need an interactive assistant and knows exactly what he needs. He executes one command with flags:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh \
  --template=minimal \
  --theme=compose \
  --output=./client-prototype \
  --environment=production \
  --minify \
  --performance-track
```

**Command Breakdown:**
- `--template=minimal`: He chooses the minimal template that contains nothing extra, ensuring maximum build and site speed
- `--theme=compose`: He connects the needed theme (corporate theme would be ideal here)
- `--environment=production`: Optimized for production use
- `--minify`: Enables asset minification
- `--performance-track`: Monitors build performance
- He **doesn't** specify `--components`, so heavy components like Quiz Engine won't be included in the build

**Result: Boris gets a clean, fast website perfect for client demonstration in 30 seconds.**

### Performance Analysis

Boris can check the build performance:

```bash
# Show build performance report
./scripts/build.sh --performance-history

# Compare different template performance
./scripts/build.sh --template=minimal --performance-track --output=minimal-test
./scripts/build.sh --template=default --performance-track --output=default-test
./scripts/performance.sh stats
```

## Use Case #3: Content Reuse

**User:** Project manager at `info-tech-io`.

**Goal:** The same educational module (e.g., `mod_linux_base`) needs to be presented in two different formats: as a full-featured, interactive course on the main site and as a simple, "lightweight" version for internal use or printing.

### User Story

> **As** an educational platform manager,
> **I want** to use the same source content to build multiple site variants with different functionality and styling,
> **So that** I can efficiently reuse materials without duplication and synchronization overhead.

### Implementation

The user has a content folder for the `mod_linux_base` course. They execute two different commands:

#### 1. Full Version for Website

```bash
./scripts/build.sh \
  --template=default \
  --theme=compose \
  --components=quiz-engine,analytics \
  --content=../mod_linux_base/content \
  --output=./public/linux-base \
  --performance-track \
  --environment=production
```

This uses the `default` template with all "batteries included", including Quiz Engine and analytics.

#### 2. Lightweight Version for Print

```bash
./scripts/build.sh \
  --template=minimal \
  --theme=compose \
  --content=../mod_linux_base/content \
  --output=./internal/linux-base-printable \
  --environment=development \
  --no-components \
  --performance-track
```

This uses the minimal template optimized for printing without interactive elements.

### Performance Comparison

```bash
# Compare performance between versions
./scripts/build.sh --performance-history
./scripts/performance.sh stats

# Cache effectiveness between builds
./scripts/build.sh --cache-stats --template=default
./scripts/build.sh --cache-stats --template=minimal
```

**Result: From one content source, two completely different products are generated, solving the reuse challenge 100%.**
