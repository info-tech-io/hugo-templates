ls -la my-website/
```

**You should see:**
```
my-website/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      # Your homepage
â”œâ”€â”€ about/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html  # About page
â”œâ”€â”€ css/           # Stylesheets

```

### Preview Your Site

```bash

:root {
  --main-color: #3b82f6;     /* Blue - change to your favorite */
  --accent-color: #10b981;   /* Green - change to your favorite */
}

## Step 6: Share Your Site (Optional)

### Option A: Netlify (Easiest)

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up for free
3. Drag and drop your `my-website` folder
4. Get your live URL instantly!

### Option B: GitHub Pages

```bash
# Create GitHub repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "My first website"

# Push to GitHub (create repository first on github.com)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-website.git
git push -u origin main

# Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
```

Your site will be live at: `https://yourusername.github.io/my-website`

## Common Customizations

### Add More Pages

```bash
# Create a projects page
mkdir -p templates/minimal/content/projects
cat > templates/minimal/content/projects/_index.md << 'EOF'
---
title: "My Projects"
---

# My Projects

Here are some projects I've worked on:

## Project 1
Description of your first project.

## Project 2
Description of your second project.
EOF
```

### Add Navigation Menu

```bash
nano templates/minimal/hugo.toml
```

**Add menu configuration:**
```toml
# Add navigation menu
[[menu.main]]
  name = "Home"
  url = "/"
  weight = 1

[[menu.main]]
  name = "About"
  url = "/about/"
  weight = 2

[[menu.main]]
  name = "Projects"
  url = "/projects/"
  weight = 3
```

### Change Fonts

```bash
nano templates/minimal/static/css/custom.css
```

**Add font changes:**
```css
/* Import Google Fonts */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap');

/* Apply new font */
body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Site Doesn't Load?

```bash
# Check if files exist
ls -la my-website/index.html

# Try different port
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then go to http://localhost:8080
```

### Build Errors?

./scripts/build.sh --template=minimal --debug --verbose

# Validate your content

```

### Content Not Showing?
