# Testing Documentation

Welcome to the Hugo Templates Framework testing documentation. This section provides comprehensive information about our testing infrastructure, standards, and best practices.

## Overview

Our testing strategy ensures code quality, prevents regressions, and maintains system reliability through a comprehensive suite of automated tests.

**Current Test Status:**
- **Total Tests**: 78 BATS unit tests ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **(+123% from Stage 5)**
- **Pass Rate**: 100% ‚úÖ (78/78 passing)
- **Test Coverage**: **79%** of all functions ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **(+26% improvement)**
  - build.sh: **74%** coverage ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (+42%)
  - error-handling.sh: **82%** coverage ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (+14%)
- **Test Framework**: BATS (Bash Automated Testing System)

**Stage 5 Achievements (Coverage Enhancement)**:
- ‚úÖ Added 43 new tests (16 HIGH priority, 13 MEDIUM priority, 11 edge cases, 1 integration)
- ‚úÖ All critical build functions now fully tested
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive edge case coverage implemented
- ‚úÖ Integration test for complete build workflow

## Quick Start

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
./scripts/test-bash.sh --suite unit

# Run with verbose output
./scripts/test-bash.sh --suite unit --verbose

# Run specific test file
./scripts/test-bash.sh --suite unit --file tests/bash/unit/build-functions.bats

# Run tests and generate coverage report
./scripts/test-bash.sh --suite unit --coverage
```

### Test Organization

Tests are organized by category and functionality:

```
tests/bash/unit/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-functions.bats      # Build system tests (57 tests)
‚îÇ                             # - Original: Tests #1-19
‚îÇ                             # - Stage 5: Core build functions, CLI, cache, edge cases
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ error-handling.bats        # Error handling tests (21 tests)
‚îÇ                             # - Original: Tests #20-35
‚îÇ                             # - Stage 5: Error logging, trap handlers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helpers/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-helpers.bash      # Shared test utilities and mocks
```

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach follows these core principles:

### 1. **Comprehensive Coverage**
- Test all critical functionality
- Cover both happy paths and error scenarios
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Maintain ‚â•95% coverage for core files

### 2. **Quality Over Quantity**
- Tests must validate real functionality, not just execute code
- Each test should have a clear purpose
- Avoid redundant or overlapping tests
- Write tests that fail when they should

### 3. **Test Isolation**
- Each test runs independently
- No shared state between tests
- Proper setup and teardown
- Use temporary directories for test data

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Clear, descriptive test names
- Well-organized test structure
- Comprehensive comments
- Follow established patterns

### 5. **Continuous Improvement**
- Update tests when code changes
- Add tests for bug fixes
- Improve test quality over time
- Document testing patterns

## Documentation Sections

### [Test Inventory](test-inventory/)
Complete catalog of all tests in the project with metadata, categorization, and purpose descriptions.

**Contents:**
- Full list of all 78 tests (35 original + 43 Stage 5 additions)
- Test metadata (category, complexity, file location, line numbers)
- What each test validates
- Test organization by category and file
- Test quality metrics and improvements

### [Testing Guidelines](guidelines/)
Detailed standards and best practices for writing and maintaining tests.

**Contents:**
- BATS test anatomy and structure
- Common patterns with DO/DON'T examples
- Mock function best practices
- Test isolation techniques
- Real-world examples from our codebase
- Troubleshooting guide

### [Coverage Matrix](coverage-matrix/)
Analysis of test coverage with identification of gaps and priorities.

**Contents:**
- Function-by-function coverage mapping (37/47 functions tested = 79%)
- Coverage percentages by file (build.sh: 74%, error-handling.sh: 82%)
- Stage 5 improvements documented (+26% overall improvement)
- Identified gaps with priority ratings
- Resolved critical gaps (update_hugo_config, prepare_build_environment, run_hugo_build)
- Scenario coverage analysis (happy path, error scenarios, edge cases)

## Test Categories

Our tests are organized into the following categories:

### **Validation Tests**
Tests that verify input validation and parameter checking.
- Template validation
- Configuration validation
- Parameter handling

### **Configuration Tests**
Tests for configuration loading and parsing.
- Module configuration loading
- Component configuration parsing
- JSON/YAML parsing

### **Error Handling Tests**
Tests for error detection, reporting, and recovery.
- Error detection and logging
- Context management
- Function tracking
- Safe operations

### **Integration Tests**
Tests that verify end-to-end functionality.
- Complete build workflows
- Component integration
- Multi-step processes

## Testing Tools

### BATS (Bash Automated Testing System)
Our primary testing framework for shell scripts.

**Key Features:**
- TAP-compliant output
- Simple, readable test syntax
- Built-in assertions
- Setup/teardown support

**Example Test:**
```bash
@test "validate_parameters accepts valid template" {
    TEMPLATE="corporate"
    PROJECT_ROOT="$(pwd)"

    run validate_parameters
    [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
    assert_contains "$output" "Parameter validation completed"
}
```

### Test Helpers
Shared utilities in `tests/bash/unit/helpers.bash`:

- `assert_contains` - Check output contains string
- `create_test_module_config` - Generate test configurations
- `simulate_permission_error` - Test permission handling
- `run_safely` - Run commands with proper error capture

## Best Practices Summary

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Write descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use proper test isolation
- Follow established patterns
- Document complex test logic
- Keep tests focused and simple

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Skip negative testing
- Rely on execution order
- Use `run` when checking variables
- Create tests that always pass
- Leave commented-out code
- Ignore test failures

## Contributing to Tests

When contributing code to Hugo Templates Framework:

1. **Write tests for new features** - All new functionality requires tests
2. **Update tests for changes** - Modify existing tests when changing behavior
3. **Add tests for bug fixes** - Prevent regressions with test coverage
4. **Follow testing guidelines** - Use established patterns and standards
5. **Document test purpose** - Clear comments explaining what's tested

See [Testing Guidelines](guidelines/) for detailed contribution standards.

## Continuous Integration

All tests run automatically in our CI/CD pipeline:

- **On every push** - Full test suite execution
- **On pull requests** - Must pass before merging
- **On releases** - Comprehensive validation

CI configuration: `.github/workflows/test.yml`
