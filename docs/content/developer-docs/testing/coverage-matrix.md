# Test Coverage Matrix

This document provides a high-level overview of the test coverage for the Hugo Templates Framework. As of the latest updates, the project has achieved comprehensive test coverage across all critical components.

## Overall Coverage Summary

- **Total Tests**: 185 (BATS)
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (185/185)
- **Coverage Status**: âœ… HIGH

The test suite is divided into three main categories, ensuring that both individual functions and end-to-end workflows are thoroughly validated.

| Test Suite          | Test Count | Coverage Focus                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unit Tests**      | 78         | Core build logic, error handling, and utility functions. |
| **Integration Tests** | 52         | Full build workflows, real-world error scenarios, and feature interactions. |
| **Federation Tests**  | 55         | Multi-module federated build system, including configuration, merging, and deployment. |
| **Total**           | **185**    | **Comprehensive System Validation**                  |

## Coverage by Component

### Build System (`scripts/build.sh`)
- **Coverage**: HIGH
- **Description**: The core build script is extensively covered by both unit and integration tests. All critical functions, from parameter validation to the Hugo build execution, are tested. Error scenarios, such as missing dependencies or invalid configurations, are validated in the integration suite.

### Error Handling (`scripts/error-handling.sh`)
- **Coverage**: EXCELLENT
- **Description**: The structured logging and error handling system is thoroughly tested. Unit tests cover individual logging functions, context management, and safe execution wrappers. The effectiveness of the error handling is validated end-to-end in the integration test suite.

### Federated Build System (`scripts/federated-build.sh`)
- **Coverage**: HIGH
- **Description**: The federated build system has its own dedicated suite of 55 tests. These cover configuration parsing, module downloading, content merging, path rewriting, and end-to-end simulations of complex, multi-module site builds.

## Current Status

The test suite is considered complete and robust. The previous coverage gaps identified in earlier development stages have been fully addressed. The 100% pass rate in the CI environment demonstrates the reliability and stability of both the application and its tests.

There are no known critical gaps in test coverage at this time. Future development will require new tests to be added to maintain this high standard.
